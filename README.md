## Overview of LLM4AD
LLM-for-Autonomous-Driving (LLM4AD) refers to the application of Large Language Models(LLMs) in autonomous driving. We divide existing works based on the perspective of applying LLMs: planning, perception, question answering, and generation.

## Motivation of LLM4AD
The orange circle represents the ideal level of driving competence, akin to that possessed by an experienced human driver. There are two main methods to acquire such proficiency: one, through learning-based techniques within simulated environments; and two, by learning from offline data through similar methodologies. It’s important to note that due to discrepancies between simulations and the real-world, these two domains are not fully the same, i.e. sim2real gap. Concurrently, offline data serves as a subset of real-world data since it’s collected directly from actual surroundings. However, it is difficult to fully cover the distribution as well due to the notorious long-tailed nature of autonomous driving tasks. The final goal of autonomous driving is to elevate driving abilities from a basic green stage to a more advanced blue level through extensive data collection and deep learning.
